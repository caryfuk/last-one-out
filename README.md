# Last One Out

This version just lets the computer play randomly against you. If we wanted the computer to win, we would need to implement some sort of a strategy.

If the strategy is implemented and given that both players follow the best strategy, it probably wouldn't be fair.
- If the amount of items is 1x+0, first player can always win.
- If the amount of items is 1x+1, first player can always win
- If the amount of items is 1x+2, second player can always win

# Last One Out

This version just lets the computer play randomly agains you. If we wanted the computer to win, we would need to implement some sort of strategy.

If the strategy is implemented, would the game be fair?

Given that both players follow the best strategy, it probably wouldn't be fair:
- If the amount of items is 1x+0, first player can always win.
- If the amount of items is 1x+1, first player can always win
- If the amount of items is 1x+2, second player can always win
